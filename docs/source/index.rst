torch_blue -- A PyTorch-based framework for Bayesian learning and uncertainty estimation
========================================================================================

Release: |release|

``torch_blue`` provides a simple way for non-expert users to implement and train
Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Currently, it only supports Variational Inference (VI),
but will hopefully grow and expand in the future. To make the user experience as easy as
possible most components mirror components from `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_.

``torch_blue`` is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/torch-blue/>`_ under the
name ``torch-blue``. If you need further instructions, check the
:ref:`installation guide <installation>`.

To learn how you can use ``torch_blue`` you can read the
:ref:`quickstart guide <quickstart>`.
